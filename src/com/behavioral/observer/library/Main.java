/**
 * Note: Observer interface isn't perfect and is deprecated since Java 9.
 * One of its cons is that Observable isn't an interface but a class, that's why subclasses can't be used as observables.
 *
 * Also, a developer could override some of the Observableâ€˜s synchronized methods and disrupt their thread-safety.
 *
 * PropertyChangeListener interface is recommended instead of using Observer.
