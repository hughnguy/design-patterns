package com.patterns.structural.composite;

/**
 * Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and
 * then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
 *
 * Imagine having two objects, Products and Boxes. A Box can contain several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes.
 * These little Boxes can also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes, and so on.
 * In order to get the total price, you have to know the classes of Products and Boxes youâ€™re going through,
 * the nesting level of the boxes and other nasty details beforehand.
 *
 * The Composite pattern suggests that you work with Products and Boxes through a common interface
 * which declares a method for calculating the total price.
 *
 * Another example is creating a File System application where all folders can contain additional folders/files.
 * All of the entities have to implement a common interface in order to recursively iterate and search for directories/files.
 *
 * Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.
