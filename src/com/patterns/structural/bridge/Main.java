/**
 * Bridge pattern lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes
 * into two separate hierarchies.
 *
 * Say you have a geometric Shape class with a pair of subclasses: Circle and Square. You want to extend this class
 * hierarchy to incorporate colors, so you plan to create Red and Blue shape subclasses. However, since you already
 * have two subclasses, youâ€™ll need to create four class combinations such as BlueCircle and RedSquare.
 * Adding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially
 *
 * You can instead extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference
 * an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class.
